how mongo db works?
    frontend ->  node js -> mongodb server -> storage engine(wired tiger) ->database

    storage engine(wiredtiger)
          do read and write data files
          we write in json format but data store in bson format(binary represenatation of json)
          this convertion is done by storage engine 
          bson use because it's prefromance efficiency,imporved data
